        <p>It is raining heavily outside and you run into nearest building seeking shelter. The door closes behind you and locks itself. You hear a voice tempting you walk further into the building. A trapdoor opens in the middle of the ground, and you land a room with the walls made of concrete. You can't get back to where you were./p>
